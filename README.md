Python (TensorFlow) code is for MAP inference via SGD

Matlab code is for Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling

PBDN_MAP_SGD.py: reproduce the results of PBDN with SGD based MAP inference in Tables 1-3 and 5

Demo_PBDN_GibbsSampling.m: reproduce the results of PBDN with Gibbs sampling in Tables 2, 3, and 5

Demo_PBDN_TwoSpirals.m: reproduce Figure 1
